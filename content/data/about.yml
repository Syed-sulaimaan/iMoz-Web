work:
- company: Tempestronics
  position: Fullstack Engineer
  duration: Jul 2014 - Present · 8 years 6 months
  location: India (Remote)
  summary: "What started as a side business during my university days turned into my company when I had it registered at the end of my college. Originally, I was building final year projects for fellow classmates for a small fee. That worked out great as it was lesser than other centers charged and I explained everything well. So after college, I had my business registered, and started app development for entrepreneurs and startups under the banner 'Tempestronics' which in latin roughly translates to “the study of time”, hence the logo is a bunch of gears—which is what watches and clocks are engineered with). I've been representing myself as a business ever since and billing under this company despite being a freelancer for all practical purposes."
