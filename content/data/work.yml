  summary: "What started as a side business during my university days turned into my company when I had it registered at the end of my college. Originally, I was building final year projects for fellow classmates for a small fee. That worked out great as it was lesser than other centers charged and I explained everything well. So after college, I had my business registered, and started app development for entrepreneurs and startups under the banner 'Tempestronics' which in latin roughly translates to “the study of time”, hence the logo is a bunch of gears—which is what watches and clocks are engineered with). I've been representing myself as a business ever since and billing under this company despite being a freelancer for all practical purposes."

  location: Bengaluru, Karnataka, India
  summary: "Given the design, I had built the entire product from scratch (Backend, Android App and DevOps to deploy it to a bare metal server). After launch the app gained ~50k users within 6 months with a rating of 4.8 on the play store. The client promised equity and gave me a position of interim CTO, where I took care of all the technical operations, marketing, management, and hiring through technical interviews including raising funds from the Idea2PoC Scheme, and Karnataka Startup Policy by pitching to a panel of VCs. However, in the end, he failed to keep up with his word of the promised equity so I left."
