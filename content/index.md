I'm Mohsin, a freelance fullstack developer based out of Bangalore, India. I build web, mobile, voice and watch apps, converting designs into pixel-perfect apps, and the best part--I single-handedly build the backend, frontend, set up the server (DevOps, CI/CD pipeline) all rolled in one being. My expertize is with native Android (using Kotlin) and Laravel on the web.

Besides coding, I also give talks, occasionally conduct workshops to [educate](http://hello.com) students and also volunteer to teach Engish to underprivileged children at an NGO. I love working with open source code which you can find on Github and my hobbies include singing at karaokes, playing the guitar, swimming, reading novels, skating, food tasting and occasionally playing football, badminton and cooking.
